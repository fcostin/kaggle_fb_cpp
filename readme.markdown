Random Walk with Restart
========================

Overview
--------

A C++ implementation of a very localised random walk with restart for the facebook recruiting competition on kaggle.com

Random walks about a source node are restricted to subgraph about the source node generated via breadth-first search. This is done for each of the ~260,000 source nodes for which predictions need to be made.
