submission 1:

    did depth 3 bfs to generate local subdomains
    used 0.1 restart parameter for random walk with restart
    solely used given directed graph, didnt do anything tricky for the reverse edges

    got a pretty bad score, although better than the two initial benchmarks


submission 2:

    extended code to walk along reverse edges for both bfs and random walk
    increased restart prob from 0.1 to 0.3 (intution : since i truncate
    domain at depth 3 with bfs there are probably some strong edge effects
    at the artificial cuts - using higher restart prob should make these
    weaker).

submission 3:

    as submission 2, but add artificial sink node to graph, direct all
    truncated edges to feed into that, dont allow it to be included
    in predictions. otherwise, still uses depth 3 and restart prob 0.3,
    although with some optimisations to code for speed.

submission 4:

    as submission 3, but with restart prob 0.6
